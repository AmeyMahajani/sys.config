# How to Uninstall Hadoop from Your System

Here's a step-by-step guide to completely removing Hadoop from your Linux/macOS system using terminal commands.

## Method 1: If Installed via Package Manager

### For Ubuntu/Debian:
bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge hadoop*
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get clean


### For CentOS/RHEL:
bash
sudo yum remove hadoop*
sudo yum autoremove


## Method 2: Manual Uninstallation

If you installed Hadoop manually, follow these steps:

### 1. Stop all Hadoop services
bash
stop-all.sh  # or stop-dfs.sh and stop-yarn.sh separately


### 2. Remove Hadoop directories
bash
# Remove installation directory (default is /usr/local/hadoop)
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/hadoop

# Remove Hadoop data directories
sudo rm -rf /tmp/hadoop*
sudo rm -rf /var/hadoop*
sudo rm -rf /app/hadoop/tmp


### 3. Remove Hadoop user (if created)
bash
sudo deluser hadoop
sudo delgroup hadoop


### 4. Clean up environment variables
Edit these files to remove Hadoop-related entries:
bash
sudo nano /etc/environment
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
sudo nano ~/.bash_profile
sudo nano ~/.profile


Remove lines containing:
- HADOOP_HOME
- HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME
- HADOOP_COMMON_HOME
- HADOOP_HDFS_HOME
- YARN_HOME
- Any Hadoop-related PATH additions

### 5. Reload environment
bash
source ~/.bashrc


### 6. Remove Hadoop from Java classpath
Check and clean:
bash
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/java.sh


### 7. Verify removal
bash
which hadoop  # Should return nothing
hadoop version  # Should show "command not found"


## Additional Cleanup (if needed)

### Remove Hadoop logs:
bash
sudo rm -rf /var/log/hadoop*


### Remove configuration files:
bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/hadoop


### Remove temporary files:
bash
sudo rm -rf /tmp/hsperfdata_*


## Important Notes

1. Backup any important data from HDFS before uninstalling
2. If you're using a managed Hadoop distribution (Cloudera, Hortonworks), use their uninstall tools
3. Some residual files might remain in user home directories (~/.hadoop, ~/.hdfs)
4. For complete removal, you may also want to uninstall Java if it was installed solely for Hadoop

After completing these steps, Hadoop should be completely removed from your system.
